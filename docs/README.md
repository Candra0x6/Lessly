# Fundly Platform Documentation

## Overview

The Fundly platform is a decentralized application built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that connects MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) with investors through revenue-sharing NFTs. The platform enables MSMEs to tokenize future revenue streams and allows investors to purchase these tokens, creating a new funding mechanism for small businesses.

## Core Features

- **MSME Registration & Verification**: Businesses can register on the platform and submit documentation for verification
- **Revenue-Sharing NFTs**: MSMEs can create NFTs that represent a percentage of their future revenue
- **Marketplace**: Investors can purchase NFTs directly from MSMEs or secondary markets
- **Revenue Distribution**: Automatic distribution of reported revenue to NFT holders
- **Token Economy**: $FND tokens serve as the platform's native currency
